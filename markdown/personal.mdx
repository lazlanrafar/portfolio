    A passionate full-stack dev who has wrangled React, Vue, Node, and PostgreSQL into
    submission for over 4 years. Loves building things people *actually* use and isn’t afraid
    of production fire (as long as there's coffee). Believes CI/CD is love, Docker is life,
    and that dark mode is a lifestyle.
